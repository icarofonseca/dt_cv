This repo contains two standard-based examples of digital twins. The first is an application for live monitoring of a toy boat's motion in 3 degrees of freedom.
* Access the app at https://icarofonseca.github.io/dt_cv/aquarium_demo.

The second is a digital twin for monitoring and control of a wave basin experiment with a scale model ship.
* Replay of the experiments: https://icarofonseca.github.io/dt_cv/basin_demo.html.
